Champion: (b.out) 
	Choose territory:	
		chooses first territory in list
	Place Armies:
		random
	Move Armies:
		all territories (str>1) move to a random neutral/enemy neighbor
Challenger: (a.out)
	Choose territory:
		Weight list: weight = 1000 - 40*(superbonus/supersize) 
		Smallest weight is best
	Place Armies:
		weight list of owned based on neighbors: 
			on first enemy neighbor seen
				weight += 50
			on first neutral neighbor seen
				weight += 100
			if this neighbor (enemy or neutral) is in the same superregion
				weight += 100*superbonus/supersize
		if armies > 50, don't give more
		biggest weight is best
		divide armies:
			give 2 armies to biggest army, 1 to the 2nd biggest
			divide the rest of the armies to them proportionally by weight
	Move Armies:
		for each region that has str>4
			for each neighbor
				if enemy:
					weight = 200
					if my attack can kill all their defenders
						weight += 10 
					if this is in the same superregion
						weight += 1000
				if neutral:
					weight = 100
					if my attack can kill all their defenders
						weight += 10 
					if this is in the same superregion
						weight += 1000
				if me:
					weight = 10
		biggest weight is best

	new ideal order :

Challenger changes:
Result		Description
25, 72, 3	best
35, 65, 0	ideal target order, neutral attacks went from just being greater number, to being atk*.568 > def
25, 73, 2   started giving all armies to one territory
27, 70, 3	divided units based on need
16, 80, 4	made tactical moves more weighted
31, 68, 1	made attacks based on powers?
35, 64, 1	check for bad neighbors
36, 60, 4	substract the current army from the needed units before giving them out
37, 59, 4	sorted the superregions

a: 484 48%, b: 461 46%, tie: 55 5%, total: 1000 	edited test framework added 'wait to conquer last region in super' concept
